RUN vs CMD
---------------------------------
when you run systemctl start catalogue
it will create one nodejs process and this process will run for infinte time....

CMD instruction is to make your container running ..

RUN ----> runs at the time of image building
CMD ----> runs at the time of container creation

Every container is a process....

systemctl commands will not work in containers....
