RUN vs CMD[More popular question]
---------------------------------
when you run systemctl start catalogue, the following happens
it will create one nodejs process and this process will run for infinte time....

CMD instruction is to make your container running ..

RUN ----> runs at the time of image building
CMD ----> runs at the time of container creation. [Container is nothing but running version of a image]

Every container is a process....

systemctl commands will not work in containers....

command should be foreground and attach to the screen, then you should send it to the background

LABEL
LABEL instruction adds metadata to the instruction.

we can give tag or some labels to identify the specific image/container from a bunch of resources

EXPOSE
This command is used to expose the port, specifically related to that container


COPY 
this command is used a file from a location to default location of that container 


COPY vs ADD 
----------------------------
both are used to copy the files from local to image  .... but ADD have 2 extra capabilities

1. It an directy download files from internet
2. It can directy untar the tar files.


CMD vs ENTRYPOINT
-----------------------------------
both these commands at the time of container creation, but what's the differn=ence between them ???
1. CMD command can be overridden by another command at run time
2. ENTRYPOINT command can't be overridden, if you try to do so, the command you are entering at run time will go and append to ENTRYPOINT

We can use CMD and ENTRYPOINT for best results

1. You can use CMD instruction to supply default arguments to ENTRYPOINT
2. user can always override CMD arguments from run time .


ARG vs ENV
--------------------------
ARG instruction can provide vaues to the Dockerfile only at buildtime. ENV variables have access in the container


ONBUILD
------------------------------------
author of image: I want to force users of image to follow something
