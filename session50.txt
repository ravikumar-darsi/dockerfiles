---------------------------------
when you run systemctl start catalogue, the following happens
it will create one nodejs process and this process will run for infinte time....

CMD instruction is to make your container running ..

RUN ----> runs at the time of image building
CMD ----> runs at the time of container creation. [Container is nothing but running version of a image]

Every container is a process....

systemctl commands will not work in containers....

command should be foreground and attach to the screen, then you should send it to the background

LABEL

This command is used to expose the port, specifically related to that container
